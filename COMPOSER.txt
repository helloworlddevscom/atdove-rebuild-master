This file contains misc notes about the contents of composer.json.
Because composer.json is JSON, we cannot add comments within the file itself.

"Require": {
 - Added drupal/group and drupal/entity using aliases in order to allow updating group
 to version compatible with drupal/ginvite. drupal/group is a dependency of opigno/opigno_lms but is locked to 1.2
 in their composer.json. Aliasing allows us to "meet" that requirement but actually use 1.4 instead, which
 meets drupal/ginvite requirement. Once Opigno requires drupal/group 1.4, we can remove these two requires from our composer.json.
