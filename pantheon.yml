        description:
          Run database updates, import config and clear caches. deploy workflow occurs only on test, live envs. If you deploy
          using lando env-deploy (recommended), these commands will be run by that script. However, we also need this hook to ensure
          these commands are run when someone deploys using the Pantheon dashboard instead. This means that when the deploy script
          is used, drush commands are actually run twice, but that should hopefully not be an issue.
